Profiling
Profiling a program means running it and keeping tracks of some measures: time, memory used, how many times an istruction is  used, etc.
So it means that we're taking care of alot of other stuff other than just the result.
Ways of profiling:
> by hand
    write manually on the program to print some output that are specific in some key nodes

> use tools
    cProfile, is a library built-in module in python which is specifically designed to profile the program wrote
            << lesson-03_08-example1.py >>

    It is possible to get the time and plot them in order to get a nice understanding on how performing it is
    The cProfile will be the subject of this laboratory
