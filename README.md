# GenomicsUniBO
Repository of UniBo's Genomics course material. 

> It's not an official page of the University of Bologna.

This repository contains notes, resumes, mock exams and common exam questions from the bachelor degree.  

It is very welcome help to keep the repository updated with new material.  
Therefore, feel free to propose a push or add new branches to add additional material not part of any courses.

Guidelines:
- When adding a file, its name should be: [course] _ [module] _ [resume/notes] _ [author name and surname initial / unknown]
- Add files to the corresponding year folder inside the course folder
- DO NOT SHARE EXAM ANSWERS (mock exams are fine)
- DO NOT SHARE Bioinformatics homeworks
